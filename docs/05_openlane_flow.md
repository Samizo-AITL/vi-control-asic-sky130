# 🏭 OpenLane Flow (RTL → GDS)

This chapter explains how the RTL developed in previous chapters
is transformed into a **manufacturable ASIC layout (GDS)**
using **OpenLane** and **SkyWater SKY130**.

The focus is on **understanding the flow**, not just running commands.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Chapter

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:

- What happens at each stage of the OpenLane flow
- Why each step is required
- How to interpret basic PPA (Performance / Power / Area) results
- How digital control logic maps onto physical silicon

---

## 🧰 Toolchain Overview

The OpenLane flow integrates several open-source tools:

- **Yosys** – RTL synthesis
- **OpenROAD** – Floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing
- **Magic / KLayout** – Layout viewing and DRC
- **Netgen** – LVS (Layout vs. Schematic)

All steps target the **SkyWater SKY130 open PDK**.

---

## 📂 OpenLane Directory Structure

A typical OpenLane design directory looks like this:

```text
openlane/
└─ vi_control_core/
   ├─ config.tcl
   ├─ pin_order.cfg
   └─ runs/
```

The `config.tcl` file defines clock parameters,
utilization targets, and design constraints.

---

## ⚙️ Key Configuration Parameters

Important parameters in `config.tcl` include:

- `DESIGN_NAME`
- `VERILOG_FILES`
- `CLOCK_PORT`
- `CLOCK_PERIOD`
- `FP_CORE_UTIL`

Example (conceptual):

```tcl
set ::env(CLOCK_PORT) "clk"
set ::env(CLOCK_PERIOD) "20.0"
set ::env(FP_CORE_UTIL) 50
```

These values directly affect **timing, area, and routability**.

---

## 🧠 Step 1: Synthesis

During synthesis:

- RTL is translated into a gate-level netlist
- Flip-flops, adders, and multipliers are mapped to standard cells

Key outputs include:

- Gate count
- Estimated timing
- Area estimate

This is the first point where **silicon cost becomes visible**.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Floorplanning

Floorplanning defines:

- Core area size
- Aspect ratio
- IO pin placement
- Power grid strategy

For control ASICs:

- Moderate utilization (40–60%) is recommended
- Simple rectangular layouts are usually sufficient

---

## 🧭 Step 3: Placement

During placement:

- Standard cells are placed inside the core area
- Timing-driven optimization is applied

At this stage, you can observe:

- Cell density
- Early timing slack
- Congested regions

---

## ⏱ Step 4: Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)

CTS inserts clock buffers to ensure:

- Low skew
- Balanced clock distribution

For this design:

- Single clock domain
- No gated clocks

This simplicity greatly improves robustness and timing closure.

---

## 🛣 Step 5: Routing

Routing connects all placed cells:

- Global routing
- Detailed routing

Key checks include:

- No open or shorted nets
- Acceptable congestion
- Reasonable wire lengths

---

## 🔍 Step 6: DRC and LVS

Final sign-off checks:

### DRC (Design Rule Check)
Ensures the layout follows all manufacturing rules.

### LVS (Layout vs. Schematic)
Ensures the layout matches the synthesized netlist.

Passing both checks is mandatory for **tapeout readiness**.

---

## 📊 PPA Analysis

After completion, evaluate:

- **Performance**: Maximum achievable clock frequency
- **Power**: Estimated dynamic and leakage power
- **Area**: Core and die size

For educational control ASICs:

- Performance margins are usually generous
- Area is dominated by arithmetic units
- Power is modest due to low operating frequency

---

## 🧠 Educational Insight

Seeing RTL transformed into geometry
is a critical learning milestone.

At this point, you should be able to:

- Point to where the PID logic resides on silicon
- Relate control complexity to chip area
- Understand timing as a physical, not abstract, property

---

## 🏁 Completion

```
You have now completed the full journey:
Control Theory
 → Fixed-Point Arithmetic
   → RTL Design
     → FSM & PWM
       → OpenLane
         → GDS
```

This is the essence of practical digital ASIC design.

## 🖼 Final Layout (GDS → Magic)

The figure above shows the final placed-and-routed layout
generated by OpenLane and visualized using **Magic**
on the SKY130 process.

## 📌 Next Steps (Optional)

Possible extensions include:

- Adding SPI register interfaces
- Integrating test and debug features
- Exploring alternative clock periods
- Tapeout via MPW shuttle services
